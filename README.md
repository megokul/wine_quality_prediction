# 🧠 Wine Quality Prediction Pipeline 🍷

A modular, production-ready machine learning pipeline that predicts wine quality based on physicochemical tests. Built with Python, scikit-learn, and follows clean architecture principles using config-driven orchestration and modular components.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔄 **End-to-End ML Pipeline** with separate stages:
  - Data Ingestion
  - Data Validation
  - Data Transformation
  - Model Training (ElasticNet)
  - Model Evaluation (with MLflow support)
  - Model Prediction

- 🧾 **Config-driven** using `config.yaml`, `params.yaml`, and `schema.yaml`

- ✅ **Schema validation** to ensure clean and consistent input

- 🧪 **Testable and Modular Design** with reusable components

- 📦 **Logging & Artifacts**: All intermediate outputs and models are logged and saved for reproducibility


## 📊 Dataset

The model uses the **Wine Quality Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
- Predicts wine quality (0–10) based on chemical tests.
- Columns include:
  - `fixed acidity`, `volatile acidity`, `citric acid`, `residual sugar`, `chlorides`, etc.


## 🧪 How to Run the Pipeline

### 1. 📦 Clone the repo & install dependencies

git clone https://github.com/megokul/pilotproject.git
cd pilotproject
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. ⚙️ Update config files
Edit config/config.yaml, params.yaml, and schema.yaml based on your dataset path or training preferences.

3. ▶️ Run pipeline stages
You can run the full pipeline or trigger specific stages:

python main.py
Each stage like ingestion, transformation, training, etc. is modularized in the src/pilotproject/pipeline directory.

🧠 Model Info
